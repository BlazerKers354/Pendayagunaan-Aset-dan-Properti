# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived files that are no longer actively used but kept for reference.

## Structure:
- `setup_database.py` - Database initialization script (archived)
- `create_prediction_tables.py` - Prediction table creation script (archived)
- `app.db` - SQLite database file (archived, using MySQL now)

## Note:
These files are kept for historical reference and potential future use. The main application now uses different approaches for database management and predictions.
