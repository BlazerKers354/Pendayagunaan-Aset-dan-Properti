# ML Models Directory

This directory contains trained machine learning models for property price prediction.

## Structure:
- `catboost_model.pkl` - CatBoost regression model
- `random_forest_model.pkl` - Random Forest regression model  
- `xgboost_model.pkl` - XGBoost regression model
- `model_comparison.csv` - Model performance comparison results

## Usage:
These models are used by the prediction system to estimate property prices based on input features. The models are loaded and used in the `prediction_models.py` module.
